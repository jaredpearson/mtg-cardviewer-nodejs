# Getting the card data
To update the card data, use the `sync` script as shown below. Make sure to check that the set symbol images for any added sets are correct.

```
npm run sync
```

# Creating the set symbol sprite
In order to make the card viewer use less network resources, all of the set symbol images are sprited. The actual images (and data) are not stored in Git but can be generated using the following command.

```
npm run createSetSymbolSprite
```

# Creating the mana cost symbol sprite
Same as the set symbol sprite but for the mana symbols.

```
npm run createManaCostsSymbolSprite
```
